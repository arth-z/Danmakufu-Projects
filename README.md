# Danmakufu-Projects
A repository for my projects in the "Touhou Danmakufu" shoot-em-up game engine and its associated C-like .dnh scripting language.
Currently contains one completed bossfight.

Watch it here:

## **How do I play these?**

Go to this [link](https://touhougc.web.fc2.com/products/th_dnh_ph3.html), (don't worry if it's in Japanese) and click the link labeled **"東方弾幕風ph3 [.1 pre6]
(2015/01/18)"** to download the most recent version of Touhou Danmakufu ph3. Extract the files to a location of your choice.

After that, take any one of the files in the main root of this repository and drag it to "script" in your Danmakufu folder. Then open *th_dnh.exe*, use your arrow keys to navigate to "directory", and take your pick of any of the scripts you want to play.

Find more Danmakufu PH3 scripts (including player scripts) at [Bulletforge](https://www.bulletforge.org/). When I'm done working on projects, you'll hopefully see them there.
I would suggest getting Danmakufu PH3 "Woo" Edition for its curvy laser optimisations, found at [this Bulletforge link](https://www.bulletforge.org/u/wishmakers/p/the-woo-pack), before you play the Junko fight. Just drag and drop the correct downloaded .exe into your Danmakufu folder, in the same location as *th_dnh.exe*.
