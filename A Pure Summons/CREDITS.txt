Massive credits to Sparen for their Danmakufu PH3 tutorials, as well as for extensive documentation:

Notable thanks to Sparen's existing code for delay lasers, screen shake, and a dialogue library which I used as a base.

Thanks to Michael Serajnik (mserajnik) for their Visual Studio Code extension for Danmakufu and .dnh files.
Without it, this would be much more difficult.

Shoutout to the base Danmakufu ph3 sample scripts too! Those shader ones were immensely helpful.

The Reimu player provided with this script is Ultima124's DDC ReimuB, and can be found at this link:

I made some slight modifications (especially for the infinite lives variant), but all the original work belongs to and was made by them!
