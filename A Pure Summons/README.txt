The intended player of this script is Ultima's DDC ReimuB (fixed) player. That means damage balancing was made with that player in mind (as well as music timing). The dialogue scene will only show Reimu talking, no matter your player character (sorry Marisa fans).

You can press the bomb key to instantly skip the entire opening dialogue.

Dialogue, nonspell, and spellcard scripts are available as playable singles for practice or fun.

In the plural, you start with only 2 lives, but you get an extend every 3 million points. Spellcard capture rewards start at 2.5 million, unless it's the survival or the final, which start at 3 and 5 million respectively. Bullets are turned into points when a boss phase is beaten as well for an alright point boost (but not as much as a spellcard capture).

Thanks for downloading, and have fun!
